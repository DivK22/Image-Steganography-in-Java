# Image Steganography

## Abstract

Steganography is the craft of concealing the way that correspondence is occurring, by concealing
data in other data. A wide range of transporter document arrangements can be utilized, however
advanced pictures are the most prevalent on account of their recurrence on the Internet. For
concealing mystery data in pictures, there exists a vast assortment of steganographic methods
some are more unpredictable than others and every one of them have separate solid and feeble
focuses. Diverse applications have distinctive necessities of the steganography method utilized.
For instance, a few applications may require outright intangibility of the mystery data, while
others require a bigger mystery message to be covered up.

In the following project we are concentrating on least significant bit of the image and modi-
fying it in spatial domain. We have broken down and concluded about the variations of this
algorithm as far as efficiency and hiding capacity of an image. Viability of the algorithm is
estimated by client assessments deciding so, all things considered change to the pictures wound
up evident.
